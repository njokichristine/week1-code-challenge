Introduction
The if statement is a statement used as a control Flow,it let's you conditionally process a statement when the specific expression evaluates to true. Since most content in the challenges has been written with if statements we shall see more examples below.

Challenge 2
In this Challenge we see more usage of the if statement but we see it in doing arithmetics where we are calculating the speed. We see a given instruction below: if (speed <= 70){ console.log("ok") //if (speed) is (<= 70) that means we give the instruction "ok". The console.log this outputs a message to the web console. //Once you go to inspect, then console. The message may be a single string--with optional sub values, or may be any one or more JavaScript objects.

introduction
We have different examples of the if statement, in this case its if statement in arithmetics, where it transfers control to the 1st, 2nd, or third label if the value of the arithmetic expression is less than zero, equal to zero, or greater than zero, respectively. This is just an example of how the if statements work in arithmetics.

Challenge 3
In this final Challenge we see the use of not just if but the let variable too, in this we have used the if statement to be able to get the salary, gross and other content that we need. Let variable is a keyword that is used to declare a block scoped variable, signal variable may be reassigned.

Introduction
let salary; let benefits; let NHIF; let NSSF; let PAYE; In these 5 let variables we are stating what we want the if function to do or rather what function to carry with this content that we have in the 'let'. We move below we see it action; if (gross <= 24000) { PAYE = (gross*0.1) We are also calculating the gross--we see the content we had in the let statement here the last let statement had let PAYE; which the if statement now knows how to run this function, which without the 'let' the if statement would be undefined this further makes the statement truthy.
